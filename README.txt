Assessment for Goldsmiths IGGI Course (Development)
===================================================

Completed in Unity 4.x by Nas, Andrei, Mihail and Tom.

Most (all?) things coded from scratch. Marvel at our awesome programmer *3*D art (no crappy sprites here!).

Readme added because Github won't shut up till you add one.

Control the game (at the moment - 24/11/14) by using WASD/Arrow keys and Space bar.
